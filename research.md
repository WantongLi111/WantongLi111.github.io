## Project 1 – Multi-layer Soil Moisture Controlling Land Carbon Cycle

I analyzed relationships (non-linear, based on machine learning) between vegetation and hydro-meteorological controls using multi-layer soil moisture. The results highlighted the distinct roles of near-surface and sub-surface soil moisture in regulating vegetation productivity and greenness.

Vegetation water supply goes deeper in drier seasons, related to the root plasticity of plants. Semi-arid shrubs often exhibit high root plasticity, as confirmed by several site-level studies.

This study recently motivated external scientists to quantify the control of surface and subsurface soil moisture on vegetation using in-situ measurements

## Project 2 – Increased Vegetation Water Limitation Since the Satellite Era

I quantified the sensitivity of vegetation leaf area index to near- and sub-surface soil moisture using ensemble observations and models, and found a widespread increase in sensitivity driven by an ecosystem memory effect and precipitation dynamics. This study also revealed a non-linearity in vegetation responses to soil moisture variability and unraveled discrepancies in land surface modeling.

The results indicate a strong sensitivity (or vulnerability) to water limitation in dry ecosystems, implying long-term ecosystem adaptation or degradation in response to climate change. Our findings have been supported by other groups, with studies further illustrating CO₂ effects on vegetation water sensitivity

## Project 3 – Can Vegetation Leaf Area Tell All the Changes of Vegetation Functions Under Drought?

I synthesized recent remote sensing observations—including leaf area index, sun-induced fluorescence, land surface temperature, and vegetation optical depth—to quantify the effects of drought on vegetation. This study disentangled vegetation physiology from canopy structure at a global scale, addressing a long-standing challenge due to limited direct observations.

The findings indicate that vegetation physiology decouples from vegetation structure under drought stress, particularly in humid ecosystems, largely due to physiological regulation such as stomatal closure. Accurately quantifying drought impacts on the terrestrial carbon sink requires careful consideration of vegetation physiological variability.

## Project 4 – Vegetation and Climate Regulate Drought Propagation to Blue and Green Water Fluxes

I investigated the global propagation of soil moisture drought in both the hydrosphere (blue water flux, runoff) and the biosphere (green water flux, land evaporation). The study identified contrasting drought responses between evaporation and runoff, and between dry and wet regions. Land surface models tend to overestimate drought-induced evaporation deficits due to inadequate modeling of soil water processes—findings consistent with recent work on biased evaporation predictions under drought  
*(e.g., Zhao et al., Nat. Clim. Change, 2022, DOI: 10.1038/s41558-022-01505-3)*.

These insights are crucial for understanding the potential and limitations of land surface models in realistically informing society about drought propagation. The initial analysis was conducted by an MSc student I supervised; after a successful master’s defense, I continued and completed the study.

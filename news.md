# News

Here are a few announcements coming soon or which have just happened:

- **April 2024:** I will talk about the covariation between forest age shifts and the net carbon balance at the European Geosciences Union. My presentation is part of the *Present and Future Global Vegetation Dynamics and Carbon Stocks from Observations and Models* session. [The abstract can be found here.](#)

- **February 2024:** I will participate in the R2D2 workshop organized by Viola Heinrich to discuss the quantification of regrowth and recovery from deforestation and degradation at large scale.

# News

Here are a few announcements coming soon or which have just happened:

- **Project Update, April 2025:** In collaboration with PI Sung-Ching Lee at MPI-BGC(https://bgc.iwww.mpg.de/en/bgi/ecomet), we welcomed Dr. Jiaye Ping as a Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow. She will join us to investigate the regulation of climate extremes on global carbon uptake and release through our bi-national collaboration between the U.S. and Germany, starting in October 2024!

- **Preprint Update, March 2025:** The preprint of *Diagnosing Syndromes of Biosphere-Atmosphere-Socioeconomic Change* ([view on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08874)) was sent out for peer review on *One Earth*. This perspective work offers a data-driven approach for monitoring, integrating, and diagnosing the dynamic interactions among the biosphere, atmosphere, and socioeconomic activities. Under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Markus Reinstein and with the support of a broad scientific team, we presented a prototype and summarized the main interactions between natural and urban systems.

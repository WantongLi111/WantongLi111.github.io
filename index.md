# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher (Feb 2023 – now) at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in the Department of Biogeochemical Integration. I did my PhD at the same institute and successfully defended it with distinction in June 2023.

I was born in a small city in eastern China, where I have often seen the human fingerprint on the environment. By participating in various environmental protection projects (winter bird habitat assessment, mangrove forest restoration, urbanisation and historical heritage trade-off, pollution investigation in marinated onion production, etc.) during my time on campus in China, I made my career goal to understand global change and mitigate climate risks.

My PhD expertise was built on multi-opportunity (vegetation greenness, SIF, LST, VOD) remote sensing vegetation monitoring and analysis regarding its long-term water limitation or extreme conditions (soil moisture, terrestrial water storage, etc.). Sometimes I also analyze land surface/Earth system model outputs and eddy covariance carbon or energy fluxes.

My postdoctoral project adds another dimension—socio-economic change. I am building a framework/index to summarise socio-economic changes that are closely linked to biospheric and atmospheric variability. This framework will help to comprehensively track and monitor planetary change and provide a direction for sustainable development.
